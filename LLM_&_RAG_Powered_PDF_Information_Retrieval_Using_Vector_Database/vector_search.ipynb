Despite the ubiquitous\\nadoption of production-scale deep learning frameworks like Ten-\\nsorFlow or PyTorch, these general-purpose frameworks fall short\\nof business demands in recommendation scenarios for various rea-\\nsons: on one hand, tweaking systems based on static parameters and\\ndense computations for recommendation with dynamic and sparse\\nfeatures is detrimental to model quality; on the other hand, such\\nframeworks are designed with batch-training stage and serving\\nstage completely separated, preventing the model from interacting\\nwith customer feedback in real-time. These issues led us to reex-\\namine traditional approaches and explore radically different design\\nchoices. In this paper, we present Monolith1, a system tailored\\nfor online training. Our design has been driven by observations\\nof our application workloads and production environment that re-\\nflects a marked departure from other recommendations systems.\\nOur contributions are manifold: first, we crafted a collisionless em-\\nbedding table with optimizations such as expirable embeddings\\nand frequency filtering to reduce its memory footprint; second, we\\nprovide an production-ready online training architecture with high\\nfault-tolerance; finally, we proved that system reliability could be\\ntraded-off for real-time learning.

In pursuit of a better customer experience,\\ndelivering personalized content for each individual user as real-time\\nresponse is a common goal of these business applications. To this\\nend, information from a user’s latest interaction is often used as\\nthe primary input for training a model, as it would best depict a\\nuser’s portrait and make predictions of user’s interest and future\\nbehaviors.\\nDeep learning have been dominating recommendation models\\n[5,6,10,12,20,21] as the gigantic amount of user data is a natural\\nfit for massively data-driven neural models. However, efforts to\\nleverage the power of deep learning in industry-level recommen-\\ndation systems are constantly encountered with problems arising\\nfrom the unique characteristics of data derived from real-world\\nuser behavior. These data are drastically different from those used\\nin conventional deep learning problems like language modeling or\\ncomputer vision in two aspects:\\n(1)The features are mostly sparse, categorical and dynamically\\nchanging;\\n(2)The underlying distribution of training data is non-stationary,\\na.k.a.

Such an enormous embedding table would\\nhardly fit into single host memory;\\n•Worse still, the size of embedding table is expected to grow\\nover time as more users and items are admitted, while frame-\\nworks like [ 1,17] uses a fixed-size dense variables to repre-\\nsent embedding table.\\nIn practice, many systems adopt low-collision hashing [ 3,6] as a\\nway to reduce memory footprint and to allow growing of IDs. This\\nrelies on an over-idealistic assumption that IDs in the embedding\\ntable is distributed evenly in frequency, and collisions are harmless\\nto the model quality. Unfortunately this is rarely true for a real-\\nworld recommendation system, where a small group of users or\\nitems have significantly more occurrences. With the organic growth\\nof embedding table size, chances of hash key collision increases\\nand lead to deterioration of model quality [3].\\nTherefore it is a natural demand for production-scale recommen-\\ndation systems to have the capacity to capture as many features in\\nits parameters, and also have the capability of elastically adjusting\\nthe number of users and items it tries to book-keep.1.2 Non-stationary Distribution\\nVisual and linguistic patterns barely develop in a time scale of\\ncenturies, while the same user interested in one topic could shift\\ntheir zeal every next minute.

In a Worker-\\nPS architecture, machines are assigned different roles; Worker ma-\\nchines are responsible for performing computations as defined by\\nthe graph, and PS machines stores parameters and updates them\\naccording to gradients computed by Workers.\\nIn recommendation models, parameters are categorized into two\\nsets: dense and sparse. Dense parameters are weights/variables in\\na deep neural network, and sparse parameters refer to embedding\\ntables that corresponds to sparse features. In our design, both dense\\nand sparse parameters are part of TensorFlow Graph, and are stored\\non parameter servers.\\nSimilar to TensorFlow’s Variable for dense parameters, we de-\\nsigned a set of highly-efficient, collisionless, and flexible HashTable\\nB A D C G\\nD E F C BT0\\nT1A\\nh0(A) \\nh1(B) h0(C) h1(D) \\nFigure 3: Cuckoo HashMap.operations for sparse parameters. As an complement to Tensor-\\nFlow’s limitation that arises from separation of training and in-\\nference, Monolith’s elastically scalable online training is designed\\nto efficiently synchronize parameters from training-PS to online\\nserving-PS within short intervals, with model robustness guarantee\\nprovided by fault tolerance mechanism.\\n2.1 Hash Table\\nA first principle in our design of sparse parameter representation\\nis to avoid cramping information from different IDs into the same\\nfixed-size embedding. Simulating a dynamic size embedding table\\nwith an out-of-the-box TensorFlow Variable inevitably leads to ID\\ncollision, which exacerbates as new IDs arrive and table grows.\\nTherefore instead of building upon Variable , we developed a new\\nkey-value HashTable for our sparse parameters.\\nOurHashTable utilizes Cuckoo Hashmap [ 16] under the hood,\\nwhich supports inserting new keys without colliding with existing\\nones. Cuckoo Hashing achieves worst-case 𝑂(1)time complexity\\nfor lookups and deletions, and an expected amortized 𝑂(1)time for\\ninsertions. As illustrated in Figure 3 it maintains two tables 𝑇0,𝑇1\\nwith different hash functions ℎ0(𝑥),ℎ1(𝑥), and an element would\\nbe stored in either one of them. When trying to insert an element\\n𝐴into𝑇0, it first attempts to place 𝐴atℎ0(𝐴); Ifℎ0(𝐴)is occupied\\nby another element 𝐵, it would evict 𝐵from𝑇0and try inserting 𝐵\\ninto𝑇1with the same logic. This process will be repeated until all\\nelements stabilize, or rehash happens when insertion runs into a\\ncycle.\\nMemory footprint reduction is also an important consideration\\nin our design. A naive approach of inserting every new ID into\\ntheHashTable will deplete memory quickly. Observation of real\\nproduction models lead to two conclusions:\\n(1)IDs that appears only a handful of times have limited con-\\ntribution to improving model quality. An important obser-\\nvation is that IDs are long-tail distributed, where popular\\nIDs may occur millions of times while the unpopular ones\\nappear no more than ten times. Embeddings corresponding\\nto these infrequent IDs are underfit due to lack of training\\ndata and the model will not be able to make a good estima-\\ntion based on them. At the end of the day these IDs are not\\nlikely to affect the result, so model quality will not suffer\\nfrom removal of these IDs with low occurrences;\\n(2)Stale IDs from a distant history seldom contribute to the\\ncurrent model as many of them are never visited. This could\\npossibly due to a user that is no longer active, or a short-\\nvideo that is out-of-date. Storing embeddings for these IDs\\ncould not help model in any way but to drain our PS memory\\nin vain.\\nBased on these observation, we designed several feature ID fil-\\ntering heuristics for a more memory-efficient implementation of\\nHashTable :\\n(1)IDs are filtered before they are admitted into embedding\\ntables. We have two filtering methods: First we filter by\\ntheir occurrences before they are inserted as keys, where the\\nthreshold of occurrences is a tunable hyperparameter that\\nvaries for each model; In addition we utilize a probabilistic\\nfilter which helps further reduce memory usage;', metadata={'source': 'G:\\\\CORE-3\\\\OPEN_AI_1\\\\VECTOR_DB_SEARCH\\\\Monolith_Real Time Recommendation System_BD.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n",

The expire time is also tunable for\\neach embedding table to allow for distinguishing features\\nwith different sensitivity to historical information.\\nIn our implementation, HashTable is implemented as a Tensor-\\nFlow resource operation. Similar to Variable , look-ups and updates\\nare also implemented as native TensorFlow operations for easier\\nintegration and better compatibility.\\n2.2 Online Training\\nIn Monolith, training is divided into two stages (Figure 1):\\n(1)Batch training stage. This stage works as an ordinary Tensor-\\nFlow training loop: In each training step, a training worker\\nreads one mini-batch of training examples from the stor-\\nage, requests parameters from PS, computes a forward and\\na backward pass, and finally push updated parameters to\\nthe training PS. Slightly different from other common deep\\nlearning tasks, we only train our dataset for one pass. Batch\\ntraining is useful for training historical data when we modify\\nour model architecture and retrain the model;\\n(2)Online training stage. After a model is deployed to online\\nserving, the training does not stop but enters the online train-\\ning stage. Instead of reading mini-batch examples from the\\nstorage, a training worker consumes realtime data on-the-fly\\nand updates the training PS. The training PS periodically syn-\\nchronizes its parameters to the serving PS, which will take\\neffect on the user side immediately. This enables our model\\nto interactively adapt itself according to a user’s feedback in\\nrealtime.2.2.1 Streaming Engine. Monolith is built with the capability of\\nseamlessly switching between batch training and online training.\\nThis is enabled by our design of streaming engine as illustrated by\\nFigure 4.\\nIn our design, we use one Kafka [ 13] queue to log actions of users\\n(E.g. Click on an item or like an item etc.) and another Kafka queue\\nfor features. At the core of the engine is a Flink [ 4] streaming job for\\nonline feature Joiner. The online joiner concatenates features with\\nlabels from user actions and produces training examples, which are\\nthen written to a Kafka queue. The queue for training examples is\\nconsumed by both online training and batch training:\\n•For online training, the training worker directly reads data\\nfrom the Kafka queue;\\n•For batch training, a data dumping job will first dump data\\nto HDFS [ 18]; After data in HDFS accumulated to certain\\namount, training worker will retrieve data from HDFS and\\nperform batch training.\\nUpdated parameters in training PS will be pushed to serving PS\\naccording to the parameter synchronization schedule.\\n2.2.2 Online Joiner. In real-world applications, user actions log\\nand features are streamed into the online joiner (Figure 5) without\\nguarantee in time order. Therefore we use a unique key for each\\nrequest so that user action and features could correctly pair up.\\nThe lag of user action could also be a problem. For example, a\\nuser may take a few days before they decide to buy an item they\\nwere presented days ago. This is a challenge for the joiner because\\nif all features are kept in cache, it would simply not fit in memory.\\nIn our system, an on-disk key-value storage is utilized to store\\nfeatures that are waiting for over certain time period. When a user\\naction log arrives, it first looks up the in-memory cache, and then\\nlooks up the key-value storage in case of a missing cache.', metadata={'source': 'G:\\\\CORE-3\\\\OPEN_AI_1\\\\VECTOR_DB_SEARCH\\\\Monolith_Real Time Recommendation System_BD.pdf', 'page': 3}),\n",

To prevent positive examples from being\\noverwhelmed by negative ones, a common strategy is to do negative\\nsampling. This would certainly change the underlying distribution\\nof the trained model, tweaking it towards higher probability of\\nmaking positive predictions. As a remedy, we apply log odds cor-\\nrection [ 19] during serving, making sure that the online model is\\nan unbiased estimator of the original distribution.\\n2.2.3 Parameter Synchronization. During online training, the Mono-\\nlith training cluster keeps receiving data from the online serving\\nmodule and updates parameters on the training PS. A crucial step\\nto enable the online serving PS to benefit from these newly trained\\nparameters is the synchronization of updated model parameters. In\\nproduction environment, we are encountered by several challenges:\\n•Models on the online serving PS must not stop serving when\\nupdating. Our models in production is usually several ter-\\nabytes in size, and as a result replacing all parameters takes a\\nwhile. It would be intolerable to stop an online PS from serv-\\ning the model during the replacement process, and updates\\nmust be made on-the-fly;\\n•Transferring a multi-terabyte model of its entirety from train-\\ning PS to the online serving PS would pose huge pressure\\nto both the network bandwidth and memory on PS, since it\\nrequires doubled model size of memory to accept the newly\\narriving model.\\nFor the online training to scale up to the size of our business\\nscenario, we designed an incremental on-the-fly periodic parameter\\nsynchronization mechanism in Monolith based on several notice-\\nable characteristic of our models:(1)Sparse parameters are dominating the size of recommenda-\\ntion models;\\n(2)Given a short range of time window, only a small subset of\\nIDs gets trained and their embeddings updated;\\n(3)Dense variables move much slower than sparse embeddings.\\nThis is because in momentum-based optimizers, the accumu-\\nlation of momentum for dense variables is magnified by the\\ngigantic size of recommendation training data, while only\\na few sparse embeddings receives updates in a single data\\nbatch.\\n(1) and (2) allows us to exploit the sparse updates across all feature\\nIDs. In Monolith, we maintain a hash set of touched keys, repre-\\nsenting IDs whose embeddings get trained since the last parameter\\nsynchronization. We push the subset of sparse parameters whose\\nkeys are in the touched-keys set with a minute-level time interval\\nfrom the training PS to the online serving PS. This relatively small\\npack of incremental parameter update is lightweight for network\\ntransmission and will not cause a sharp memory spike during the\\nsynchronization.\\nWe also exploit (3) to further reduce network I/O and memory\\nusage by setting a more aggressive sync schedule for sparse pa-\\nrameters, while updating dense parameters less frequently. This\\ncould render us a situation where the dense parameters we serve is\\na relatively stale version compared to sparse part. However, such\\ninconsistency could be tolerated due to the reason mentioned in (3)\\nas no conspicuous loss has been observed.\\n2.3 Fault Tolerance\\nAs a system in production, Monolith is designed with the ability to\\nrecover a PS in case it fails.

As described in Section 2.1, embedding\\ntables in Monolith are implemented as collisionless HashTable s.\\nTo prove the necessity of avoiding collisions in embedding tables\\nand to quantify gains from our collisionless implementation, we\\nperformed two groups of experiments on the Movielens dataset\\nand on our internal production dataset respectively:\\n(1)MovieLens ml-25m dataset [ 11]. This is a standard public\\ndataset for movie ratings, containing 25 million ratings that\\ninvolves approximately 162000 users and 62000 movies.\\n•Preprocessing of labels . The original labels are ratings from\\n0.5 to 5.0, while in production our tasks are mostly re-\\nceiving binary signals from users. To better simulate our\\nproduction models, we convert scale labels to binary labelsby treating scores≥3.5as positive samples and the rest\\nas negative samples.\\n•Model and metrics . We implemented a standard DeepFM\\n[9] model, a commonly used model architecture for recom-\\nmendation problems. It consist of an FM component and a\\ndense component (Figure 6). Predictions are evaluated by\\nAUC [ 2] as this is the major measurement for real models.\\n•Embedding collisions . This dataset contains approximately\\n160K user IDs and 60K movie IDs. To compare with the\\ncollisionless version of embedding table implementation,\\nwe performed another group of experiment where IDs are\\npreprocessed with MD5 hashing and then mapped to a\\nsmaller ID space. As a result, some IDs will share their\\nembedding with others.

This model generally follows a\\nmulti-tower architecture, with each tower responsible for\\nlearning to predict a specialized kind of user behavior.\\n•Each model has around 1000 embedding tables, and distri-\\nbution of size of embedding tables are very uneven;\\n•The original ID space of embedding table was 248. In our\\nbaseline, we applied a hashing trick by decomposing to\\ncurb the size of embedding table. To be more specific, we\\nuse two smaller embedding tables instead of a gigantic\\none to generate a unique embedding for each ID by vector\\ncombination:\\n𝐼𝐷𝑟=𝐼𝐷%224\\n𝐼𝐷𝑞=𝐼𝐷÷224\\n𝐸=𝐸𝑟+𝐸𝑞,\\nwhere𝐸𝑟,𝐸𝑞are embeddings corresponding to 𝐼𝐷𝑟,𝐼𝐷𝑞.\\nThis effectively reduces embedding table sizes from 248\\nto225;\\n•This model is serving in real production, and the perfor-\\nmance of this experiment is measured by online AUC with\\nreal serving traffic.\\n3.1.2 Online Training. During online training, we update our on-\\nline serving PS with the latest set of parameters with minute-level\\nintervals.

We also did quite some exploration in this\\nregard and to our surprise, model quality is more robust than\\nexpected. With a 0.01% failure rate of PS machine per day,\\nwe find a model from the previous day works embarrassingly\\nwell. This is explicable by the following calculation: Suppose\\na model’s parameters are sharded across 1000 PS, and they\\nsnapshot every day. Given 0.01% failure rate, one of them\\nwill go down every 10 days and we lose all updates on this\\nPS for 1 day. Assuming a DAU of 15 Million and an even\\ndistribution of user IDs on each PS, we lose 1 day’s feedback\\nfrom 15000 users every 10 days. This is acceptable because\\n(a) For sparse features which is user-specific, this is equiv-\\nalent to losing a tiny fraction of 0.01% DAU; (b) For dense\\nvariables, since they are updated slowly as we discussed in\\n2.2.3, losing 1 day’s update out of 1000 PS is negligible.\\nBased on the above observation and calculation, we radically\\nlowered our snapshot frequency and thereby saved quite a\\nbit in computation overhead.\\n4 RELATED WORK\\nEver since some earliest successful application of deep learning to\\nindustry-level recommendation systems [ 6,10], researchers and\\nengineers have been employing various techniques to ameliorate\\nissues mentioned in Section 1.\\nTo tackle the issue of sparse feature representation, [ 3,6] uses\\nfixed-size embedding table with hash-trick. There are also attempts\\nin improving hashing to reduce collision [ 3,7]. Other works directly\\nutilize native key-value hash table to allow dynamic growth of table\\nsize [ 12,15,20,21]. These implementations builds upon TensorFlow\\nbut relies either on specially designed software mechanism [ 14,\\n15,20] or hardware [ 21] to access and manage their hash-tables.\\nCompared to these solutions, Monolith’s hash-table is yet another\\nnative TensorFlow operation. It is developer friendly and has higher\\ncross-platform interoperability, which is suitable for ToB scenarios.\\nAn organic and tight integration with TensorFlow also enables\\neasier optimizations of computation performance.\\nBridging the gap between training and serving and alleviation\\nof Concept Drift [ 8] is another topic of interest. To support online\\nupdate and avoid memory issues, both [ 12] and [ 20] designed fea-\\nture eviction mechanisms to flexibly adjust the size of embedding\\ntables. Both [ 12] and [ 14] support some form of online training,\\nwhere learned parameters are synced to serving with a relatively\\nshort interval compared to traditional batch training, with fault tol-\\nerance mechanisms. Monolith took similar approach to elastically\\nadmit and evict features, while it has a more lightweight parameter\\nsynchronization mechanism to guarantee model quality.', metadata={'source': 'G:\\\\CORE-3\\\\OPEN_AI_1\\\\VECTOR_DB_SEARCH\\\\Monolith_Real Time Recommendation System_BD.pdf', 'page': 8}),\n",

Our\\nsolution for online realtime serving in Monolith has a delicately\\ndesigned parameter synchronization and a fault tolerance mecha-\\nnism: In our parameter synchronization algorithm, we showed that\\nconsistency of version across different parts of parameters could be\\ntraded-off for reducing network bandwidth consumption; In fault\\ntolerance design, we demonstrated that our strategy of trading-off\\nPS reliability for realtime-ness is a robust solution.\\nTo conclude, Monolith succeeded in providing a general solution\\nfor production scale recommendation systems.\\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\\nHanzhi Zhou provided useful suggestions on revision of this paper.\\nREFERENCES\\n[1]Martín Abadi, Paul Barham, Jianmin Chen, Z.

We first elaborate\\ndesign details of how Monolith tackles existing challenge with colli-\\nsionless hash table and realtime training in Section 2. Experiments\\nand results will be presented in Section 3, along with production-\\ntested conclusions and some discussion of trade-offs between time-\\nsensitivity, reliability and model quality. Section 4 summarizes re-\\nlated work and compares them with Monolith. Section 5 concludes\\nthis work.\\nClient \\n Master \\nWorker \\n Worker \\nParameter \\nServer \\nParameter \\nServer \\n. . .\\n. . .\\nFigure 2: Worker-PS Architecture.\\n2 DESIGN\\nThe overall architecture of Monolith generally follows TensorFlow’s\\ndistributed Worker- Parameter Server setting (Figure 2). In a Worker-\\nPS architecture, machines are assigned different roles; Worker ma-\\nchines are responsible for performing computations as defined by\\nthe graph, and PS machines stores parameters and updates them\\naccording to gradients computed by Workers.\\nIn recommendation models, parameters are categorized into two\\nsets: dense and sparse. Dense parameters are weights/variables in\\na deep neural network, and sparse parameters refer to embedding\\ntables that corresponds to sparse features. In our design, both dense\\nand sparse parameters are part of TensorFlow Graph, and are stored\\non parameter servers.\\nSimilar to TensorFlow’s Variable for dense parameters, we de-\\nsigned a set of highly-efficient, collisionless, and flexible HashTable\\nB A D C G\\nD E F C BT0\\nT1A\\nh0(A) \\nh1(B) h0(C) h1(D) \\nFigure 3: Cuckoo HashMap.operations for sparse parameters. As an complement to Tensor-\\nFlow’s limitation that arises from separation of training and in-\\nference, Monolith’s elastically scalable online training is designed\\nto efficiently synchronize parameters from training-PS to online\\nserving-PS within short intervals, with model robustness guarantee\\nprovided by fault tolerance mechanism.\\n2.1 Hash Table\\nA first principle in our design of sparse parameter representation\\nis to avoid cramping information from different IDs into the same\\nfixed-size embedding. Simulating a dynamic size embedding table\\nwith an out-of-the-box TensorFlow Variable inevitably leads to ID\\ncollision, which exacerbates as new IDs arrive and table grows.\\nTherefore instead of building upon Variable , we developed a new\\nkey-value HashTable for our sparse parameters.\\nOurHashTable utilizes Cuckoo Hashmap [ 16] under the hood,\\nwhich supports inserting new keys without colliding with existing\\nones. Cuckoo Hashing achieves worst-case 𝑂(1)time complexity\\nfor lookups and deletions, and an expected amortized 𝑂(1)time for\\ninsertions. As illustrated in Figure 3 it maintains two tables 𝑇0,𝑇1\\nwith different hash functions ℎ0(𝑥),ℎ1(𝑥), and an element would\\nbe stored in either one of them. When trying to insert an element\\n𝐴into𝑇0, it first attempts to place 𝐴atℎ0(𝐴); Ifℎ0(𝐴)is occupied\\nby another element 𝐵, it would evict 𝐵from𝑇0and try inserting 𝐵\\ninto𝑇1with the same logic. This process will be repeated until all\\nelements stabilize, or rehash happens when insertion runs into a\\ncycle.\\nMemory footprint reduction is also an important consideration\\nin our design. A naive approach of inserting every new ID into\\ntheHashTable will deplete memory quickly. Observation of real\\nproduction models lead to two conclusions:\\n(1)IDs that appears only a handful of times have limited con-\\ntribution to improving model quality. An important obser-\\nvation is that IDs are long-tail distributed, where popular\\nIDs may occur millions of times while the unpopular ones\\nappear no more than ten times. Embeddings corresponding\\nto these infrequent IDs are underfit due to lack of training\\ndata and the model will not be able to make a good estima-\\ntion based on them. At the end of the day these IDs are not\\nlikely to affect the result, so model quality will not suffer\\nfrom removal of these IDs with low occurrences;\\n(2)Stale IDs from a distant history seldom contribute to the\\ncurrent model as many of them are never visited. This could\\npossibly due to a user that is no longer active, or a short-\\nvideo that is out-of-date. Storing embeddings for these IDs\\ncould not help model in any way but to drain our PS memory\\nin vain.\\nBased on these observation, we designed several feature ID fil-\\ntering heuristics for a more memory-efficient implementation of\\nHashTable :\\n(1)IDs are filtered before they are admitted into embedding\\ntables. We have two filtering methods: First we filter by\\ntheir occurrences before they are inserted as keys, where the\\nthreshold of occurrences is a tunable hyperparameter that\\nvaries for each model; In addition we utilize a probabilistic\\nfilter which helps further reduce memory usage;', metadata={'page': 2.0, 'source': 'G:\\\\CORE-3\\\\OPEN_AI_1\\\\VECTOR_DB_SEARCH\\\\Monolith_Real Time Recommendation System_BD.pdf'}),\n",

      "In this work, we present Monolith, a large-scale recommendation system designed to address the challenges of memory footprint and non-stationary distribution in recommendation systems. Monolith provides full expressive power for sparse features by designing a collisionless hash table and a dynamic feature eviction mechanism. It also incorporates online training to loop serving feedback back to training in real-time, allowing it to adapt to non-stationary user behavior. The system outperforms systems that adopt hash-tricks with collisions, achieving state-of-the-art results with similar memory usage.\n",
